# Graphs for Scrum and Agile Concepts

I am presenting the book *Scrum Fundamentals: A Beginner's Guide to Mastery of The Scrum Project Management Methodology* ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Fundamentals-Beginners-Management-Methodology-ebook/dp/B07QN85Z4C)) at the Archilife Book Club ([English website](https://en.archilife.org/)) on August 22, 2020.

Due to Archilife's copyright rules, I have to create the whole content by myself, and I cannot directly reuse other people's images without their written permission. Therefore, I created a hand-sketch of the minimum viable product concept. I also wrote `R` code to generate images of the Sprint burndown chart and project timeline evaluations.

Since I already did the work, I decided to broaden the impact by sharing my visualizations. The Archilife Book Club is not open to the public, and my slides are in Mandarin so I am not going to share them here.

The scrum-related images contain a green line and a red line, which I know that some people may not be able to see the colors. Nevertheless, the graph is readable in grayscale because the green line always have a larger slope than the red line. The two lines show the trends, which are readable in the absence of color.

In addition to the book, I also recommend the following resources:
- Agile Product Ownership in a Nutshell ([15-min YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=502ILHjX9EE&vl=en)) 
- Explaining minimum viable product ([article link](https://pabial.wordpress.com/2018/06/27/explaining-minimum-viable-product/))

Enjoy!
